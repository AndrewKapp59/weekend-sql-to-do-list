# SQL To Do List

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

I made a todo list! This app allows you to add, update, delete and sort todos that are stored in a database! You can add a custom todo by typing it out in the input field and then pressing enter or clicking the + button. The new todo will be added to the bottom of the list below the input field. Each todo will have two buttons next to it. The 'check' button allows you to mark a todo as complete or uncomplete. The 'trash' button allows

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
